# watcher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/faustinoaq/watcher.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/faustinoaq/watcher)

Crystal shard to watch file changes. This shard use the same code implemented [here (Guardian)](https://github.com/f/guardian/blob/master/src/guardian/watcher.cr#L45) and [here (Sentry)](https://github.com/samueleaton/sentry/blob/master/src/sentry.cr#L52).

## Installation

Hi!

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  watcher:
    github: faustinoaq/watcher
```

## Usage

Use the keyword `watch` to watch files or file groups, for example:

```crystal
require "watcher"

watch "src/assets/js/*.js", interval: 5.seconds do |event|
  event.on_change do |files|
    files.each do |file, timestamp|
      puts "File #{file} has changed at #{timestamp}"
    end
    # ...
  end
end
```

Aso you can have more than one watcher, just use `spawn`

```crystal
spawn do
  watch ["src/assets/*.css", "src/views/*.html"] do |event|
    event.on_change do
      # ...
    end
  end
ens
```

Also you can change time interval for a watcher.

```crystal
watch "public/big_project/*", interval: 5.seconds do |event|
  event.on_change do
    # ...
  end
end
```

Also you can use `Watcher.watch` instead of `watch`.

# How does it work?

Watcher uses timestamps to check file changes every second, if you want some more advanced then you can use [Watchbird](https://github.com/agatan/watchbird) that uses `libnotify` to check events like modify, access and delete but just work in Linux for now.
